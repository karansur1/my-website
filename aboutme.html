            <h3> My name is Karan Suri, I am 11 years old. I like legos, video games, math, and coding.
                I like making games related to space. I started coding because my brother did it and I was very interested about how he was making cool projects.
                I have been learning coding for 6 months.
                In the beginning it was tough since I was very new to coding,
                but later on it got simpler as I learnt new topics.
                    Whitehat jr has helped me learn, and has given me fun projects to do. 
                Some of the projects and games I made are in the homepage, if you want to play them go straight there!  
            If you have any ideas or need help with a game, I would be more then happy to help. You can contact me at:
